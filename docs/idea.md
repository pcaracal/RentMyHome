# Idea
- Fullstack web-application
- Users can log in and log out
- Logged-in users can create listings for their Homes
- Listing:
    - images
    - price
    - interactive calendar to show availability
    - contact data
    - redirect to buy page
    - rating (can sort by them)
- Security:
    - JWT for authentication
    - No need to think about XSS because of Angular 17
